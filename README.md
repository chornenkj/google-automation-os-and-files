This repository contains my codes, which I created to pass the course
"Interacting with Operating System with Python" by Google

Root directory contains my labs to accomplish tasks and pass separate modules.
Directory 'instructed' contains training codes which I cteated following
instructions.

This is not for use by another learners, but instead to present my skills,
I have obtained on the course.
